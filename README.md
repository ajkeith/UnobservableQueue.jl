# UnobservableQueues.jl
Order-based estimation algorithm for unobservable queues

## Installation
`Pkg.clone("https://github.com/ajkeith/UnobservableQueues.jl")`

## Algorithm
The order-based estimation algorithm is implemented in src/estimators.jl. This file also includes our implementation of the variance estimator due to Park, Kim & Willemain (2011). The LCFS versions are in src/lcfs.jl.

## Testing
Tests for the correctness of each algorithm are available in test/runtests.jl.

## Micro-Benchmarks
Micro-benchmarks are available in the benchmarks directory.

## Analysis
The experimental design, regression analysis, and plots are located in the analysis directory. All analysis was conducted in JMP.
